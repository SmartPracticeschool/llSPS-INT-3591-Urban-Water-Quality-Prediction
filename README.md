• Developed a machine learning model using linear regression to predict water quality based on pollution data.
• Designed and deployed a Flask-based interactive prediction tool with a REST API for real-time water quality
   forecasting.
• Processed structured pollution data using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, ensuring high model accuracy.
• Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as normalization and feature selection to improve model
   performance.
